# Verity — Comprehensive Project Examination

*Last updated: March 3, 2026*

> **Beta-Ready** — All five phases complete. Voice Intro, Guardian Net, Spark Reflection, push notifications, and platform stats automation are all wired end-to-end. Ready for 50–100 user pilot.

---

## 1. Primary Objectives & Intended Outcomes

Verity is a verified, safety-first speed-dating platform built around 45-second anonymous video "Drops" and a mutual Spark/Pass reveal model. The project pursues six core objectives:

1. **Authentic first impressions** — Replace swipe-based profile browsing with live 45-second video calls that surface real voice, eye contact, and presence.
2. **Zero ghosting by design** — The mutual-spark gate means identities are revealed only when both participants choose "Spark." A "Pass" is silent and private, eliminating rejection exposure.
3. **Safety-first architecture** — Real-time AI moderation during calls, server-verified identity gates (phone, selfie, safety pledge), and one-tap Safe Exit and Guardian Net for immediate protection.
4. **Privacy by default** — Participants are anonymous during the 45-second call. Personal information is withheld until mutual consent.
5. **Radical transparency** — A public Transparency page exposes platform safety statistics, moderation accuracy, appeals outcomes, and founding principles.
6. **Intention over addiction** — Scheduled Drops replace infinite scroll. No dopamine loops, no dark-pattern engagement mechanics. Revenue comes from token packs and Verity Pass subscriptions.

## 3. Current Progress & Status

### 3.1 Completed

**Frontend (14 pages, fully implemented):**
- **Landing** — Marketing narrative with Hero, Stats counter, Features grid, Innovations showcase, safety/privacy positioning, and JSON-LD structured data
- **Auth** — Supabase email/password authentication with redirect handling
- **Onboarding** — 8-step progressive flow: welcome → age verification → phone → selfie → safety pledge → preferences → profile setup → completion (each step updates `user_trust`)
- **Lobby** — Drop discovery with search/filter, RSVP management, realtime participant counts, matchmaking queue entry via `find-match`
- **LiveCall** — 45-second anonymous video via Agora, countdown timer, Spark/Pass decision capture, mutual-spark reveal with confetti animation, Guardian Net alert, Safe Exit, and in-call reporting
- **SparkHistory** — List of mutual sparks with partner info, AI insights, unread message badges, and navigation to chat
- **Chat** — Real-time text and voice messaging with read receipts via Supabase Realtime, Voice Intro banner
- **TokenShop** — 3 token packs + 2 subscription tiers (monthly/annual), integrated with Stripe Checkout, purchase success handling
- **Profile** — Avatar upload to Supabase Storage, editable display name, verification badges (phone/selfie/pledge), token balance display, subscription management via Customer Portal, sign-out
- **Admin** — Moderation queue with flag review (ban/warn/clear), appeals inbox with admin response, analytics dashboard, user management (admin-role gated)
- **Transparency** — Founding principles, safety statistics (live from `platform_stats`), moderation accuracy rates, appeals outcomes
- **Appeal** — User-facing appeal submission with explanation and optional voice note upload
- **Friendfluence** — Invite friends to Drops with generated invite links and activity ticker

**Backend (16 edge functions, 13 RPC functions):**
- All 16 edge functions deployed and functional with JWT authentication
- Atomic matchmaking with block-list filtering (`find-match`)
- Agora token issuance with server-side call participation verification (`agora-token`)
- AI moderation via real LLM (Lovable AI Gateway / Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) with structured tool-use and policy-based risk scoring (`ai-moderate`)
- Stripe payment flow: checkout creation with price-ID allowlist, webhook processing with idempotency, customer portal with origin-validated return URLs
- Admin moderation actions persisted to `moderation_flags` with audit trail
- Push notification system: VAPID key generation, subscription management, notification dispatch
- Automated platform stats aggregation via `aggregate-stats` cron
- Feature flag system via `get-feature-flags` for runtime configuration

**Security hardening:**
- JWT authentication enforced on all edge functions
- Price-ID allowlist in `create-checkout` prevents arbitrary Stripe price injection
- Origin allowlist on `create-checkout` and `customer-portal` prevents open redirect attacks
- Webhook signature verification with `stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync`
- Idempotent event processing via `stripe_processed_events` table (PK on `event_id`)
- Customer-ID mapping for deterministic Stripe lookups (replaces email-based approach)
- Agora tokens issued with 10-minute expiry and call-participation verification
- Protected routes with admin-role gating via `has_role` RPC function
- Error boundary wrapping the application root

**Testing (9 suites, 33 tests):**
- Auth capabilities and feature flag parsing
- Route guarding and protected route behavior
- Guardian Net component and Voice Intro banner
- Live call moderation wiring
- Matchmaking atomicity
- URL validation for edge functions

- Lazy loading for 10 heavy routes: Landing, LiveCall, SparkHistory, Chat, TokenShop, Admin, Transparency, Appeal, Profile, Friendfluence
- Code splitting via React.lazy + Suspense with loading spinner fallback
- Bundle optimization: `manualChunks` in Vite config splits Agora SDK, Framer Motion, Recharts, and React Router into independent vendor chunks

### 3.2 In Progress

- **AI moderation threshold tuning** — The `ai-moderate` function is invoked from active calls with transcript snippets where browser speech APIs are available. Current focus is threshold tuning and fallback quality.
- **Agora Cloud Recording credentials** — `start-cloud-recording` and `stop-cloud-recording` edge functions are deployed but require `AGORA_CUSTOMER_KEY` and `AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET` to operate.

### 3.3 Upcoming

- **Granular drop scheduling** — More control over drop timing, region targeting, and capacity management

## 4. Challenges & Mitigations

### Active Challenges

| Challenge | Severity | Details | Mitigation |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **AI moderation threshold tuning** | Moderate | `ai-moderate` function is wired into live calls but thresholds need calibration with real user data. | Run pilot Drops to collect moderation events and tune risk-score thresholds based on actual call patterns. |
| **Lint/type debt** | Moderate | `npm run lint` fails on `any` usage across onboarding, lobby, and live-call components, plus Fast Refresh warnings for non-component exports. | Add typed Supabase response models to replace `any` casts. Move shared constants and helper functions out of component files into dedicated modules. |
| **Bundle size** | Moderate | Vite build emits a >2.5 MB chunk warning. | Lazy loading for 8 routes partially addresses this. Further code splitting of heavy dependencies (Agora SDK, Stripe.js) and tree-shaking review needed. |
| **Environment secrets** | Operational | Agora App ID/Certificate, Stripe Secret Key/Webhook Secret, Supabase URL/Keys, and Lovable API Key are mandatory for call and payment flows. | Document required environment variables. Ensure deployment secrets are configured per environment (dev/staging/production) before pilots. |

### Resolved Challenges

| Challenge | Resolution |
|-----------|-----------|
| **AI moderation stub** | Upgraded from `Math.random()` score to real LLM call (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite via Lovable AI Gateway) with structured tool-use and policy-based violation detection. |
| **Payment security** | `create-checkout` now enforces JWT authentication, derives user email from session, validates request origin against an allowlist, and checks price-ID against a hardcoded map. |
| **Webhook idempotency** | Added `stripe_processed_events` table with primary key on `event_id` to prevent duplicate token credits or subscription updates. |
| **Agora token security** | Replaced client-side stubs with `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid` on the server, issuing tokens with 10-minute expiry only after verifying the requesting user is a participant in the call. |
| **Open redirect risk** | Customer portal `return_url` is validated via strict URL parsing + exact origin allowlist before creating Stripe Billing Portal sessions. |
| **Bundle performance** | Added lazy loading via `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for 10 routes and `manualChunks` in Vite config to split heavy vendor dependencies (Agora SDK, Framer Motion, Recharts, React Router) into independent chunks. |
| **Test coverage gap** | Resolved: 9 test suites with 33 passing tests covering auth capabilities, feature flags, route guarding, Guardian Net, Voice Intro, moderation wiring, matchmaking atomicity, and URL validation. |
| **Stats population** | Resolved: `aggregate-stats` edge function deployed as automated cron; Transparency and Admin pages now read live data from `platform_stats`. |

## 5. Adjustments to Original Plans

1. **AI moderation accelerated** — Upgraded from a random-score stub to a real LLM with tool-use ahead of the original "Next sprint" timeline. Now wired into live calls; threshold tuning is the remaining work.
2. **Security hardening promoted** — Originally planned for later phases, payment and token-issuance security vulnerabilities were identified and addressed immediately in Phase 2.
3. **Profile page added** — Not in the original plan; added to Phase 2 scope to provide users with account management, verification status visibility, and subscription controls.
4. **Customer-ID mapping** — The Stripe webhook originally used email-based customer lookups. Updated to use `stripe_customer_id` stored on `user_payment_info` for deterministic, reliable mapping.
5. **Lazy loading introduced** — Added code splitting for 8 routes in `App.tsx` to address the >2.5 MB bundle warning and improve initial page load performance.
6. **Transparency and appeals prioritized** — Built governance surfaces (Transparency page, Admin appeals inbox, `submit-appeal` function) before GA to establish trust infrastructure early.
7. **Trust gates as prerequisite** — Gated live Drop participation behind multi-step verification (phone, selfie, safety pledge) to reduce fraud and bad actors during the pilot phase.
8. **Phase 5 added** — Operations & Polish phase was not in the original plan; added to cover push notifications, stats automation, SEO, and test coverage.
