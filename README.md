# Verity — Anonymous Speed Dating Platform

## Project Overview

**Verity** is a verified, anonymous speed dating platform designed to solve the burnout epidemic in modern dating apps. The swipe economy is broken — 78% of dating-app users experience burnout, 80% of women report dating fatigue, and ghosting accounts for 41% of that fatigue. Verity's answer is radical: real eyes, real voice, 45 seconds, and dignity always.

**Core mechanic:** Users RSVP to themed, time-limited "Drops" (scheduled speed dating sessions). When a Drop goes live, participants are matched anonymously for a 45-second video call. Both choose Spark or Pass independently. Only a **mutual spark** reveals identities and unlocks post-call chat — no rejection notifications, ever.
**Project overview**: See [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for a detailed examination of objectives, strategy, timelines, and current status.

## Primary Objectives

| # | Objective | Outcome |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Authentic first impressions** | Replace profile-photo bias with live voice and video — real chemistry in 45 seconds |
| 2 | **Zero ghosting by design** | Mutual-spark gate means no unrequited contact; no rejection signals sent |
| 3 | **Safety first** | Live safety checks (metadata + transcript snippets where available), identity verification (phone + selfie), safety pledge, and user blocking |
| 4 | **Privacy by default** | Anonymous until mutual spark; raw call video is not stored |
| 5 | **Radical transparency** | Public safety stats, moderation rates, and gender-balance metrics published in real time |
| 6 | **Intention over addiction** | No infinite scroll, no streaks, no dopamine loops — Verity is used, not consumed |

## Strategic Plan & Milestones

### Phase 1 — Core Platform ✅ Complete
- User authentication (email/password via Supabase Auth)
- Onboarding flow with identity verification (phone + selfie + safety pledge)
- Lobby with upcoming/live Drops, RSVP management, and real-time updates
- Anonymous video calls via Agora RTC (45-second sessions)
- Mutual-spark decision mechanic with post-call chat unlock
- Spark history and chat inbox

### Phase 2 — Safety & Infrastructure ✅ Complete
- AI moderation function (`ai-moderate`) gated behind call participation check
- Matchmaking queue with Drop-scoped unique constraint
- User blocking (`user_blocks` table with RLS policies)
- Selfie verification storage bucket with per-user access controls
- Admin dashboard: moderation queue, appeals inbox, analytics, user management
- Transparency page: live safety stats, founding principles, gender balance chart
- Appeal submission flow for moderation decisions

### Phase 3 — Payments & Premium ✅ Complete
- Token shop with Stripe Checkout (starter, popular, value packs)
- Verity Pass subscription (monthly and annual tiers)
- Stripe Customer Portal for subscription management
- Stripe webhook handler with idempotency and customer-ID mapping
- Token balance and transaction history tracking

### Phase 4 — Innovations 📋 Roadmap
- **Spark Reflection** — private post-call AI insight (tone/energy analysis, no transcript)
- **Verity Voice Intro** — optional 15-second voice note before text chat unlocks after mutual spark
- **Guardian Net** — one-tap safe-call signal to a trusted friend
- **Chemistry Replay Vault** — private 8-second anonymised highlight reel (Verity Pass only)
- **Friendfluence Drops** — invite a friend to the same Drop for shared courage

## Current Progress

### Completed ✅
- Full frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript + shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS)
- All core pages: Landing, Auth, Onboarding, Lobby, Live Call, Spark History, Chat, Token Shop, Admin, Transparency, Appeal
- Supabase backend: auth, profiles, drops, calls, sparks, messages, matchmaking queue, token transactions
- Agora real-token generation with 10-minute expiry (using `agora-token` npm package)
- Security hardening: auth on all edge functions, price-ID allowlist, origin allowlist, idempotent webhooks (see `.lovable/plan.md`)
- Realtime subscriptions for drops, RSVPs, calls, and messages

### In Progress 🔄
- Tuning live moderation thresholds and browser transcript coverage fallbacks
- Phase 4 innovation features (Spark Reflection, Voice Intro, Guardian Net)

### Upcoming 📋
- Push notifications for RSVP reminders and new Spark matches
- Friendfluence Drops (group RSVP + matched pairs)
- Chemistry Replay Vault (Verity Pass gated)

## Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Payment security** — `create-checkout` accepted arbitrary `customer_email` and `success_url` from clients, enabling fraud and open-redirect attacks | Rewrote to authenticate the caller's JWT, derive email from the verified session, build redirect URLs server-side from an origin allowlist, and validate `price_id` against a hardcoded map |
| **Stripe webhook idempotency** — duplicate webhook deliveries could credit tokens or subscriptions multiple times | Added `stripe_processed_events` table (primary key on `event_id`); duplicate events return `{ received: true }` immediately |
| **Agora stub tokens** — early implementation returned placeholder tokens, breaking real calls | Replaced with `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid` (10-minute expiry); call-participation verified server-side before token is issued |
| **Open redirect in customer portal** — `return_url` was accepted verbatim from client, enabling redirect to arbitrary sites | Replaced with strict URL parsing + exact-origin allowlist validation; falls back to `/tokens` when invalid |
| **Misleading UI copy** — Lobby previously showed "AI safety on" before real-time AI moderation was wired | Changed to "Safety first" — accurate (safety pledge, blocking, and reporting exist) without overstating automation |

---

## Adjustments to Original Plans

1. **AI moderation timeline shifted** — Transcript-assisted moderation is now wired in the live call flow (with browser fallback behavior) and is being tuned before pilot launch.
2. **Security hardening promoted to Phase 2** — Originally planned for a later hardening sprint; vulnerabilities found in payment flows were addressed immediately before any public launch.
3. **Customer ID mapping added to webhook** — Original plan used email-only lookup; Stripe email can change, so `stripe_customer_id` is now stored on `profiles` for deterministic lookup.

## Development

Package manager policy: `npm` is the canonical toolchain for local dev and CI.

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint

# Build
npm run build

# Validate Supabase auth settings against runtime policy
npm run check:auth-settings

# Validate project target alignment
npm run check:project-alignment

# Guard against hardcoded Supabase credentials
npm run check:no-hardcoded-supabase
```

### Auth Provider Policy

- Canonical Supabase project: `itdzdyhdkbcxbqgukzis`
- Canonical source-of-truth matrix: [docs/environment-matrix.md](docs/environment-matrix.md)
- Strict mode default: `VITE_REQUIRE_PHONE_VERIFICATION=true`
- Temporary incident fallback: set `VITE_REQUIRE_PHONE_VERIFICATION=false` and redeploy
- Optional Google login enforcement: `VITE_REQUIRE_GOOGLE_AUTH=true`
- Full runbook: [docs/auth-unblock-runbook.md](docs/auth-unblock-runbook.md)
