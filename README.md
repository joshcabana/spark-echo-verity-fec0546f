# Verity — Anonymous Speed Dating Platform

## Project Overview

**Verity** is a verified, anonymous speed dating platform designed to solve the burnout epidemic in modern dating apps. The swipe economy is broken — 78% of dating-app users experience burnout, 80% of women report dating fatigue, and ghosting accounts for 41% of that fatigue. Verity's answer is radical: real eyes, real voice, 45 seconds, and dignity always.

**Core mechanic:** Users RSVP to themed, time-limited "Drops" (scheduled speed dating sessions). When a Drop goes live, participants are matched anonymously for a 45-second video call. Both choose Spark or Pass independently. Only a **mutual spark** reveals identities and unlocks post-call chat — no rejection notifications, ever.
**Project overview**: See [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for a detailed examination of objectives, strategy, timelines, and current status.

## Primary Objectives

| # | Objective | Outcome |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Authentic first impressions** | Replace profile-photo bias with live voice and video — real chemistry in 45 seconds |
| 2 | **Zero ghosting by design** | Mutual-spark gate means no unrequited contact; no rejection signals sent |
| 3 | **Safety first** | Live safety checks (metadata + transcript snippets where available), identity verification (phone + selfie), safety pledge, and user blocking |
| 4 | **Privacy by default** | Anonymous until mutual spark; raw call video is not stored |
| 5 | **Radical transparency** | Public safety stats, moderation rates, and gender-balance metrics published in real time |
| 6 | **Intention over addiction** | No infinite scroll, no streaks, no dopamine loops — Verity is used, not consumed |

## Strategic Plan & Milestones

### Phase 1 — Core Platform ✅ Complete
- User authentication (email/password via Supabase Auth)
- Onboarding flow with identity verification (phone + selfie + safety pledge)
- Lobby with upcoming/live Drops, RSVP management, and real-time updates
- Anonymous video calls via Agora RTC (45-second sessions)
- Mutual-spark decision mechanic with post-call chat unlock
- Spark history and chat inbox

### Phase 2 — Safety & Infrastructure ✅ Complete
- AI moderation function (`ai-moderate`) gated behind call participation check
- Matchmaking queue with Drop-scoped unique constraint
- User blocking (`user_blocks` table with RLS policies)
- Selfie verification storage bucket with per-user access controls
- Admin dashboard: moderation queue, appeals inbox, analytics, user management
- Transparency page: live safety stats, founding principles, gender balance chart
- Appeal submission flow for moderation decisions

### Phase 3 — Payments & Premium ✅ Complete
- Token shop with Stripe Checkout (starter, popular, value packs)
- Verity Pass subscription (monthly and annual tiers)
- Stripe Customer Portal for subscription management
- Stripe webhook handler with idempotency and customer-ID mapping
- Token balance and transaction history tracking

### Phase 4 — Innovations ✅ Complete
- **Friendfluence Drops** — Invite a friend to the same Drop for shared courage (UI + invite link generation live at `/drops/friendfluence`)
- **Spark Reflection** — Private post-call AI insight (tone/energy analysis via Lovable AI Gateway)
- **Verity Voice Intro** — Optional 15-second voice note before text chat unlocks after mutual spark
- **Guardian Net** — One-tap safe-call signal to a trusted friend (server-side alert logging to `guardian_alerts`)

### Phase 5 — Operations & Polish ✅ Complete
- Push notifications for RSVP reminders and new Spark matches (Web Push via VAPID keys)
- Automated platform stats aggregation (`aggregate-stats` edge function)
- JSON-LD structured data on landing page for SEO
- Unread message count badge on Sparks tab in bottom navigation
- 11 test suites with 33 passing tests (auth, feature flags, routing, Guardian Net, Voice Intro, moderation wiring, matchmaking atomicity)
- Production polish: error boundaries, lazy loading, bundle splitting via `manualChunks`
- **Chemistry Replay Vault** — 8-second anonymized highlight reel from mutual-spark calls, gated behind Verity Pass subscription, with Vault tab on Sparks page
- **Agora Cloud Recording** — Edge functions (`start-cloud-recording`, `stop-cloud-recording`) for server-side call recording; `generate-replay` extracts clips for the Vault
- Bundle optimization: `manualChunks` splits Agora SDK, Framer Motion, Recharts, and React Router into independent vendor chunks

## Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Payment security** — `create-checkout` accepted arbitrary `customer_email` and `success_url` from clients, enabling fraud and open-redirect attacks | Rewrote to authenticate the caller's JWT, derive email from the verified session, build redirect URLs server-side from an origin allowlist, and validate `price_id` against a hardcoded map |
| **Stripe webhook idempotency** — duplicate webhook deliveries could credit tokens or subscriptions multiple times | Added `stripe_processed_events` table (primary key on `event_id`); duplicate events return `{ received: true }` immediately |
| **Agora stub tokens** — early implementation returned placeholder tokens, breaking real calls | Replaced with `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithUid` (10-minute expiry); call-participation verified server-side before token is issued |
| **Open redirect in customer portal** — `return_url` was accepted verbatim from client, enabling redirect to arbitrary sites | Replaced with strict URL parsing + exact-origin allowlist validation; falls back to `/tokens` when invalid |
| **forwardRef console warnings** — React internals attaching refs to function components caused noisy dev-mode warnings | Initially wrapped components with `forwardRef`; reverted after it caused `Component is not a function` runtime crashes with Vite HMR. Remaining warnings are cosmetic, from third-party libraries (next-themes, react-helmet-async) |
| **Test coverage gap** — Only 1 placeholder test existed at launch | Resolved: 9 test suites with 33 passing tests covering auth, feature flags, routing, components, and edge function logic |
| **Stats population** — Transparency and Admin pages showed zero values | Resolved: `aggregate-stats` edge function deployed as automated cron job |
| **AI moderation stub** — Random-score stub replaced with real LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) with structured tool-use and policy-based risk scoring | Now wired into live calls; threshold tuning in progress |

---

## Adjustments to Original Plans

1. **AI moderation timeline shifted** — Transcript-assisted moderation is now wired in the live call flow (with browser fallback behavior) and is being tuned before pilot launch.
2. **Security hardening promoted to Phase 2** — Originally planned for a later hardening sprint; vulnerabilities found in payment flows were addressed immediately before any public launch.
3. **Customer ID mapping added to webhook** — Original plan used email-only lookup; Stripe email can change, so `stripe_customer_id` is now stored on `user_payment_info` for deterministic lookup.
